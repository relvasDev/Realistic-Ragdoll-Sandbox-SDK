# Rigging
The rigging process is necessary at this stage because it is difficult to find a character with rigging on the internet, or it may not be compatible.

For this, use:

- AccuRig (recommended)
- Mixamo
- Blender and Rigidify

## Rigging with AccuRig (step by step)
1. Open AccuRig
2. Click Import Character
3. Load the character file

## Adjusting the main skeleton
AccuRig will ask you to mark the main points on your body. Adjust carefully:
- Head
- Chin
- Shoulders
- Elbows
- Wrists
- Hips
- Knees
- Ankles

Use the front and side views to ensure correct alignment.

## Finger adjustment
In AccuRig, the finger rig must be configured manually. For each hand, adjust:
- Thumb (3 phalanges)
- Index
- Middle
- Ring
- Little finger Ensure that:
- Each finger is correctly aligned with the mesh
- There is no reverse rotation
- Left/right symmetry is consistent


Rig generation
After validating the body and fingers:

1. Click Calibrate
2. Wait for the process to complete
3. Quickly review the deformation in test poses

## Export to Unity
AccuRig has a specific export mode for Unity.
