# Character download

## Recommended sources
Only use models that allow use in games and mods. Common sources:
- Mixamo — ideal for beginners;
- Sketchfab (use Downloadable filters and check the license);
- CGTrader / TurboSquid (free models).

## Minimum model requirements
- Humanoid character (bipedal);
- Character in T-Pose or A-Pose;
- Single mesh (or few coherent meshes);
- No animations;
- All scales must be set to 1.1.1.

Avoid characters with proportions that are extremely outside the human standard, as this affects the stability of the ragdoll.
